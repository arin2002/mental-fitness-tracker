# Fitness Tracker with ML Model Analysis

## Overview

The Fitness Tracker with ML Model Analysis is a web application designed to assist fitness enthusiasts in selecting the most suitable machine learning model for specific fitness-related tasks. This project offers an interactive platform to input fitness data and compare the performance of different ML models to identify the optimal one for each task.

## Features

- **Fitness Data Input**: Users can input their fitness-related data, such as workout routines, diet logs, sleep patterns, heart rate, and more.

- **Machine Learning Model Analysis**: The application provides a wide range of pre-trained machine learning models for fitness-related tasks, such as activity recognition, sleep quality prediction, and calorie expenditure estimation.

- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Users can evaluate the performance of different ML models on their fitness data and compare metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Model Selection Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, the tracker suggests the most suitable ML model for specific fitness-related tasks.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can visualize their fitness data and the model predictions with interactive charts and graphs.

## Machine Learning Models

The Fitness Tracker incorporates a variety of machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based activity recognition.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for analyzing time-series data like sleep patterns.
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classifying fitness activities based on sensor data.
- Linear Regression models for predicting calorie expenditure.

Each ML model is trained on a relevant dataset and fine-tuned for the fitness domain.
